                        <b>My Educational Journey</b>
                        <p>As I mentioned before, I live in the Turkestan region, in a village called Shaulder. There are many schools in my area, but I studied at A. Baitanaev School, which was the closest to my home. I attended that school until the 6th grade. During that time, I studied well, maintaining a perfect GPA of 5.0/5.0, and I actively participated in many olympiads, especially up until the 4th grade.<br><br>In the 6th grade, I began preparing for admission to NSPM (Fizmat) school, which is one of the most competitive schools in Kazakhstan. I took two entrance exams and successfully passed them, which allowed me to start my studies at Fizmat in the 7th grade. Since then, I have been studying there for 4 years, and now I am in the 11th grade. Currently, at Fizmat, I maintain a GPA of 4.8/5.0, which reflects my consistent academic performance in a highly demanding environment.<br><br>Over these years, Fizmat has given me not only strong academic knowledge but also opportunities to develop leadership skills, participate in extracurricular activities, and work on projects that helped me grow both academically and personally.</p>

            <a>My Goal</a>
            <b>My Path to Greatness</b>
            <p>My goal is to become a skilled and innovative computer scientist who uses technology to solve real-world problems and make a meaningful impact on society. From an early age, I have been fascinated by how computers work and how programming can bring ideas to life. Over the years, this passion has grown into a clear vision for my future: to pursue a career in Computer Science, specializing in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and web development. I want not only to master the theoretical foundations of computing but also to create practical solutions that can improve people’s lives, whether through smart applications, intelligent systems, or advanced software platforms.<br><br> In high school, I have dedicated myself to building a strong academic background in mathematics, programming, and logical thinking. I have worked with different programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, and I have built projects ranging from simple applications to creative websites. These experiences have given me both confidence and motivation to continue learning and to expand my skills. In the future, I see myself working on impactful projects—developing technologies that can support education, healthcare, sustainability, and many other fields that benefit from digital transformation.<br><br>When thinking about the next step in my journey, I know that studying at a leading university will be essential. I aim to apply to top universities in the United States, Europe, and Asia that offer strong Computer Science programs, world-class professors, and opportunities for research and innovation. Universities such as Yonsei University in Korea, City University of Hong Kong, or institutions in the United States like Northeastern or UIUC inspire me with their academic environment and their global community. I want to challenge myself in such settings, learn from diverse perspectives, and contribute to the university community not only through academics but also through leadership and extracurricular activities.<br><br>My dream is not limited to obtaining a degree—it is about building a foundation for a career where I can think creatively, work collaboratively, and innovate responsibly. By combining my passion for technology with the opportunities provided by top universities, I believe I will be able to achieve my goals and make a lasting impact in the world of Computer Science.</p>
